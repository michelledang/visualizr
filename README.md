# CS 489 - Visualizr

[Visualizr](https://visualizr.vercel.app/) is a real-time audio visualizer built using [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/), [styled-components](https://styled-components.com/) and the [Web Audio API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Audio_API).

There are six visualizations available, each generated using frequency and waveform data from the selected audio source. Users can upload audio files or use their microphone audio as sources. There are also themes based on popular keycap sets. Fullscreen mode recommended!
